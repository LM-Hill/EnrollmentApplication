## General information
This is a basic website for a University Extension program that ultimately serves as an enrollment form application that collects and stores user information. The application includes login authentication for administrators with bcrypt password hashing functionality. This program also employs all elements of C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) user interface conventions. The purpose of this project is to resolve inefficiencies by streamlining the enrollment process for a community outreach program. This web-based application allows users to complete forms all at once, decreases the risk of errors (prolonging the enrollment process), and limits the number of emails sent to and received from program participants compared to previous workflow procedures.  

## Technologies

* Python version 3.6.4
* Django version 2.2.4
