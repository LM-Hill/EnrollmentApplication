## General information
This is a basic website for a University Extension program that ultimately serves as an enrollment form application that collects and stores user information. The application includes login authentication for adminstrators with bcrypt password hashing functionality. This program also employs all elements of C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) user interface conventions. The purpose of this project is to provide a real-world solution to the enrollment process for a community outreach program. The intended goal is to increase efficiency in the enrollment process. This web-based application allows users to complete forms all at once, decreases the risk of errors (prolonging the enrollment process), and limits the number of emails sent to and received from program participants compared to previous workflow procedures.
